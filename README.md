# This template has been deprecated and is no longer supported.
## Please see the "CI - Develop a secure app with DevSecOps practices" template for an alternative template with signing and signing key creation.

### Create signing key pairs that can be shared across your pipelines
This template allows you to create a [Key Protect](https://.cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/key-protect) instance or use an existing one to store private/public RSA/X.509 key pairs. The template can be used to create new keys or delete existing ones. The keys can be leveraged across your existing toolchains. For a specific example of a templete that uses theses specific keys, see the [image signed secure kube template](https://github.com/open-toolchain/image-signed-secure-kube-toolchain)
